# The Constitution of India
The Constitution of India, with each amendment as a commit.

## Objective
The Constitution has changed over time. This repo aims to track all those changes as clean git commits from the initial version to the current. 

## How to browse?
The easiest way is to look at all the commits https://github.com/prince-mishra/the-constitution-of-india/commits/master. The commit history has been cleaned up to only contain the amendments.
Each commit also has some details around the objectives of the amendment. 
Since git (and github) does not handle dates before unix epoch (1/1/1970), I have added 100 years to the real date on which the amendment was enforced. 2050 means 1950


All amendments also have associated Github issues: https://github.com/prince-mishra/the-constitution-of-india/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aamendment . In case the repo git history is cleaned up yet again, it would loose the SHAs, so if you have to link an amendment, use the Github issue instead. I'll make sure if the SHAs change, the commits still point to correct Github issues
